Whitelabel Error Page

This application has no explicit mapping for /error, so you are seeing this as a fallback.

There was an unexpected error (type=Internal Server Error, status=500).
Timed out after 30000 ms while waiting to connect. Client view of cluster state is {type=UNKNOWN, servers=[{address=mongo:27017, type=UNKNOWN, state=CONNECTING, exception={com.mongodb.MongoSocketOpenException: Exception opening socket}, caused by {java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused (Connection refused)}}]; nested exception is com.mongodb.MongoTimeoutException: Timed out after 30000 ms while waiting to connect. Client view of cluster state is {type=UNKNOWN, servers=[{address=mongo:27017, type=UNKNOWN, state=CONNECTING, exception={com.mongodb.MongoSocketOpenException: Exception opening socket}, caused by {java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused (Connection refused)}}]

This was because I changed mogo image from just mongo to mongo:3.6.17-xenial. To fix this I just changed back the mongo deployment with the previous image mongo and I was able to access my data.

After this the image was saved and when I open in new incognito window the image was shown.

### fixing issue with the images

For this you need to test when delete the pod and then open the URL in new in-private session the image disappear.

I updated the code and did again:

apply -f kube
minikube service knote --url
